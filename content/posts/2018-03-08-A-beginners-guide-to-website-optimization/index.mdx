I am a beginner, and I was able to achieve 99/100 in Google’s optimization ranking. If I can do it, you can too.

If you’re like me, you like proof. So here are [Google’s PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/) results for hasslefreebeats, a website that I maintain and recently spent some time optimizing:

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/page-speed.png"
    title="Google page speed result of 99/100"
    alt="Google page speed result of 99/100"
  />
</div>

I am pretty proud of these results, but I want to stress that I didn’t have a clue about how to optimize a website just a couple of weeks ago. What I have to share with you today is simply the result of a whole lot of googling and troubleshooting, pains I wish to spare you.

This article is broken up into subsections for each optimization, in case you want to jump around.

I am by no means an expert, but I’m confident that if you implement the techniques below, you will see results!

## Images

  />
</div>

As a beginner web-developer, images were not something I ever paid much mind to. I knew that adding high-quality images to my website would make it look more professional, but I never stopped to consider the effects they would have on my page’s load time.

The main thing I did to optimize my images was compress them.

Looking back, this should have been fairly intuitive from the get-go, but it wasn’t for me, so maybe it isn’t for you either.

The service that I used to compress my images was [Optimizilla](https://imagecompressor.com/), an easy-to-use website where you upload your images, select the level of compression you want, and then download the compressed image. I saw size decreases upwards of 70% for some of my resources, which goes a LONG way towards faster load times.

Optimizilla is hardly the only choice for your image compression needs. Some standalone, open-source software you can use is [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac) for Mac or [FileOptimizer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nikkhokkho/files/FileOptimizer/) for Windows. If you prefer to compress using build tools, there are [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-imagemin) and [WebPack](https://github.com/Klathmon/imagemin-webpack-plugin) plugins that should do the trick. It doesn’t matter so much how you do, so long as you do. The performance gains are well worth the minimal effort.

Depending on your use case, it may also be worth looking at your files’ format. Generally speaking, jpg is going to be smaller than png. The main difference in whether I use one or the other is whether I need transparency behind the image: If I need transparency, I use png, otherwise I use jpg. You can dive deeper into the pros and cons of both [here](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/jpeg-vs-png/).

Also, Google has come out with a webp format that is pretty sweet, but since it’s not supported on all browsers yet, I’m hesitant to use it. Keep an eye out for further support in the future!
I didn’t do more than compress my images to get the results I showed you above, but if you want to optimize further [here is a great article](https://www.frontamentals.com/practical-guide-to-images/).

## Video

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/video.jpeg"
    title="Video photo from Pexels"
    alt="Video photo from Pexels"
  />
</div>

I haven’t used video in any of my current projects, so I will only touch on this briefly as I do not feel I am the best resource for this, specifically.

This is one of those situations where I would likely let the pros do the heavy lifting. [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/) offers an excellent platform for hosting videos where they will degrade video quality for slower connections and compress your videos to optimize performance.

You could also host your videos on Youtube and then use this [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) tool to download them from Youtube while configuring the videos to your website’s needs.

For other possible solutions, check out [Brightcove](https://www.brightcove.com/en/), [Sprout](https://sproutvideo.com/) or [Wistia](https://wistia.com/).

## Gzip

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/zipper.jpeg"
    title="zipper photo from Pexels"
    alt="zipper photo from Pexels"
  />
</div>

I had no idea what gzipping was when I initially deployed my website.

Long story short, gzip is a file compression format that most browsers understand and that can run behind the scenes without requiring the user to even know it’s happening.

Depending on where you are hosting your application, gzipping may be as simple as flipping a configuration switch to specify that you want your server to gzip files when sending them out.

In my case, my website is hosted on Heroku, which does not provide this option.

As it turns out, there are packages to add compression explicitly in your server code, which allows you to reap the benefits of gzipping in exchange for only a few lines of code. Using this compression middleware, I was able to decrease the size of my [Javascript and CSS bundles by 75%](/How-I-decreased-the-size-of-my-Heroku-app-by-75-percent).

It is worthwhile to check if your hosting service provides a gzip option. If it does not, look into how to add gzipping to your server-side code.

## Minifying

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/pineapple.jpeg"
    title="pineapple photo from Pexels"
    alt="pineapple photo from Pexels"
  />
</div>

Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from code without affecting its functionality (whitespace, new-line characters, and so on). This allows you to decrease the size of the file you are transporting across the internet. It’s also useful for obfuscating your code, which makes it harder for sneaky hackers to detect security weak-points (if only a little bit).

These days, minifying is usually done as part of the build process with Webpack or Gulp or some alternative. These build tools can have a bit of a learning curve, however, so if you are looking for easier alternatives, Google recommends [HTML-Minifier](https://github.com/kangax/html-minifier) for HTML, [CSSNano](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano) for CSS, and [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2) for Javascript.

## Browser-Caching

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/floppy.jpeg"
    title="Floppy disc photo from Pexels"
    alt="Floppy disc photo from Pexels"
  />
</div>

Storing static files in the browser’s cache is a very efficient way to increase the speed of your website, especially on return visits from the same client. I was not aware, until Google told me, that some of my resources were not being cached appropriately because of missing headers on the HTTP response I was sending from my server.

As soon as my home page is loaded, a request is made to my server to get data about a bunch of songs which are then rendered in a music player. I don’t update the songs on this website very often, so I do not mind if a user comes to my website and sees the same songs from the last time they visited, if it will make my page load a bit faster for them.

In order to get a performance boost, I added the following code to my server’s response object
(Express/Node server):

```javascript
res.append("Cache-Control", "max-age=604800000");
res.status(200).json(response);
```

All I am doing here is appending a cache-control header to my response, which says that after one week (in milliseconds), the resources should be re-downloaded. If you update these files more often, a shorter max-age might be a good idea.

## Content Distribution Network

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/cdn.jpeg"
    title="CDN photo from Pexels"
    alt="CDN photo from Pexels"
  />
</div>

A content distribution network, or CDN, is a network that allows users from all over the world to be geographically closer to your content. If a user has to load a large image from Japan, but your server is in the United States, this will take longer than if you had a server in Tokyo.

A CDN allows you to take advantage of a bunch of proxy servers located all over the world, allowing your content to be loaded more quickly regardless of where your end-user is located.

I want to note that I was able to achieve the results you saw above **before** implementing a CDN — I simply wanted to mention them as no article about website optimization would be complete without mentioning them. Having one of these bad boys on your website is imperative if you are planning to have a worldwide audience.

Some popular CDNs include [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) and [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## Miscellaneous

Here’s a couple more tips to squeeze out even more juice:

- Optimize your website to load “above-the-fold” content first to increase the perceived performance of your site. One common way to do this is by [lazy-loading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_loading) images that don’t show up on the landing page.

- Unless your application depends on Javascript to render HTML, such as a website built with Angular or React, then it is likely safe to load your script tags at the bottom of the body section of your HTML file. This could affect your [time-to-interactive](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/time-to-interactive), however, so it is NOT a technique I would recommend for every situation.

## In Conclusion

This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to optimizing your website. Depending on the amount of traffic you are receiving and the service you are providing, you could have performance bottlenecks in many different areas. Maybe you need more servers, maybe you need a server with more RAM, maybe your triple-nested for-loop could use some refactoring — who knows?

There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to speeding up your site, and you’ll ultimately have to make the best decisions for your situation based on measurements. Don’t waste your time optimizing something that does not need optimizing. Analyze the performance of your site to find bottlenecks, then attack those specifically.

I hope that you found something useful in this article! As I mentioned, I still have a lot to learn in this domain.
